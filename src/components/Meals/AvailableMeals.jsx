Afterwards, we blended with three-year old lambikken and very young lambikken for balance and bottle fermentation.In total, we used lambikken originating from four different barrels and ten different brews. The weighted average age of the blend is almost 22 months. The final fruit intensity is 500 grams of Riesling grapes per litre of finished Druif. 100% 3 Fonteinen brewed lambik.',
